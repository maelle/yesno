# yesno

## Introduction

Provides two functions. 

The first, `yesno()`, asks a custom yes-no question with three variable responses.

The order and phrasing of the possible responses varies randomly to ensure the user consciously chooses (as opposed to automatically types their response).

The second, `yesno2()`, ask a custom yes-no question with two fixed responses.

It is designed to be used in situations where a user needs to choose one of two options both of which have consequences.

## Demonstration

```
yesno("Do you like ", R.Version()$nickname ,"?")
Do you like Bug in Your Hair?
1: Definitely
2: No way
3: No

Selection: 1
[1] TRUE

yesno("Do you like ", R.Version()$nickname ,"?")
Do you like Bug in Your Hair?
1: No way
2: Uhhhh... Maybe?
3: I agree

Selection: 2
[1] FALSE

> yesno2("Do you like this question?")
Do you like this question?
1: Yes
2: No

Selection: 1
[1] TRUE
```
